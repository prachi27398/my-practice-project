                    <p>Hi, I'm Prachiben Patel, a passionate and results-driven Full Stack Developer with over 3 years of experience in building dynamic and scalable web applications. I specialize in using PHP, Laravel, WordPress, Python and modern frontend technologies like React.js to create seamless user experiences and powerful backend systems.</p>
                    <p>I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and have also completed my Master's in Management from the University of Essex. Over the years, I've honed my expertise in integrating payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe), optimizing databases, and leveraging cloud technologies like AWS to build reliable and scalable web applications. My goal is always to ensure high performance, security, and user-centric designs in everything I develop.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy working collaboratively in agile teams, and my passion for continuous learning keeps me on top of the latest web development trends and technologies. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tools, improving my skills, or solving complex problems.</p>
                    <p>I am always excited about taking on new challenges and creating solutions that bring value to users and businesses alike. Whether it's improving web performance, implementing advanced functionality, or integrating APIs, I thrive on delivering high-quality results.</p>
